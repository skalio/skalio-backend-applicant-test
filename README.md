# Skalio backend applicant preparation

## Live Coding Challenge

This document will give you all the information you need in preparation for the interview.

This project contains an example project which we will be working on in the Live Coding Interview. Please familiarize
yourself with the project.

## Project Description

You should be able to start the example application by executing com.skalio.SkalioBackendApplicantTestApplication, which
starts a webserver on port 8080 (http://localhost:8080).

The project is based on a small web service which uses the following technologies:

* Java 11
* Spring Boot
* Database H2 (In-Memory)
* Maven
* We do provide code formatter for IntelliJ IDEA

## Interview Process

During our Live Coding Interview you will be meeting with our Backend Developers. We will be presenting you with a task
based on this project. You will share your
screen content and think aloud to walk us through the solution you will develop.

* The challenge will take approximately 60 to 90 minutes
* You can ask any kind of question to us, both relating to the task or to use us as your "Search-Engine"
* You can use any other resource you like including the internet
* We want to simulate a "pair programming" atmosphere, so we will try to support you as much as we can without giving
  the full solution
* Please "think aloud" while you work. Explain your approach, what you are doing and why while we go along.

We are looking forward to seeing you soon!
